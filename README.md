## **SDF09 Responsive Footer Design with Tailwind CSS**

### Overview

In this project, I created a responsive footer for a web page using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **Styling Elements**: I was able to style the responsive footer for a web page using Tailwind CSS.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Input**: Struggled with color/styling of the input field, creating difficulty for the user.
- **Flexbox for mobile views**: Struggled with utilising flexbox to allow for the footer to be accessible in mobile view and/or resizing the browser, failing in responsiveness.
- **Responsiveness**: Intially, my code was responsive upon clicking the subscribe button after input. I removed some code which removed the responsiveness. I would like to keep track of each code update I do, especially rushed work and time management.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Tailwind CSS**: I want to explore more Tailwind CSS properties to enhance the user experience and responsiveness of the footer.

#### Overall Learning Experience

This project was good, a bit of a challenge, I hope to improve more on Tailwind CSS.
